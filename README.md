# Effect of Meaningfulness on Working Memory

In this project, I used R to analyse data for the two experiments, which investigated the effect of semantic meaning on binding and item memory. 

Before starting the analysis, make sure there is a folder `Exp{number_of experiment}/Exp{number_of experiment}_data/data_raw.txt` in the working directory.

Instruction:
0. Choose the corresponding experiment folder
1. Run `data_preprocesisng.R` to remove participants that violated exclusion criteria
2. Run `main.R` to calculate accuracy of participants' performance and to estimate parameters of M3 
3. Run `plot_results.R` to print out figures related to accuracy, selected reponse types, posterior distribution and M3 estimates
