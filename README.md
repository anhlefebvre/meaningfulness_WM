# Effect of Meaningfulness on Working Memory

In this project, I used R to analyse data for the experiment1, which investigated the effect of semantic meaning on binding and item memory. 

Before starting the analysis, make sure there is a folder `data/data_raw.txt` in the working directory. Run `main.R` to start.
